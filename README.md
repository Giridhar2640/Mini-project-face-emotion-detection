Real-time facial emotion detection leverages machine learning to recognize human emotions like happiness, sadness, or anger from facial expressions in live video streams. The system begins by detecting faces in each video frame using methods like YOLO or Haar cascades. Preprocessing, including resizing and normalizing, readies the data for analysis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) then predicts emotions by analyzing facial features, trained on datasets like FER-2013. The detected emotions are displayed in real-time alongside the video. This technology has applications in healthcare, education, and customer service but must address challenges like lighting variations, cultural differences, and privacy concerns.
